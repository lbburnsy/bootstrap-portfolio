# Guidance

This was a really fun project! I've created a responsive portfolio using bootstrap that I am happy with at this point. All links function, and style based on viewport.

## Some Notes

My "profile" pic will be updated with a more appropriate image - it's all I had right now.
The social icons switch from the header to the footer at a breakpoint of 768px.
